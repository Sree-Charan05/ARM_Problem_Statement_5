YOLOv5 Nano – CPU vs PL Performance Results
Platform: ZCU102
Input Source: USB Webcam
Input Resolution: 640x640
Precision: INT8

--------------------------------------------------
CPU-ONLY IMPLEMENTATION (ARM Cortex-A53)
--------------------------------------------------

Measured FPS           : 0.98 FPS
Approximate Latency    : ~1020 ms per frame
Execution Domain       : Processing System (PS)
CNN Backbone           : Executed in Software
Post-Processing        : CPU (NMS)

Observation:
- Non-real-time performance.
- High latency due to software convolution execution.

--------------------------------------------------
PL-ACCELERATED IMPLEMENTATION (DPU)
--------------------------------------------------

Measured FPS           : ~23.8–24 FPS
Approximate Latency    : ~41 ms per frame
Execution Domain       : Programmable Logic (PL)
CNN Backbone           : Executed on DPU
Post-Processing        : CPU (NMS)

Observed Speedup:
24 / 0.98 ≈ 24.5× faster than CPU-only implementation.

Notes:
- Application-level FPS limited by webcam frame rate and CPU-based post-processing.
- Hardware benchmark peak is significantly higher (500.46 FPS).
